## FIFA-21-DATA_CLEANING
CLEANING  FIFA-21 DATASET USING MICROSOFT POWER QUERY

 I joined a data cleaning challenge that was hosted in the tech space on twitter, and this project was aimed at transforming the messy data into a clean usable one that would be usable for future analysis. I cleaned this data using tools available on the power query editor and this documentation describes how it was acheived

### Data cleaning description and aim
The raw fifa dataset was gotten from kaggle, and the data contains 18,979 rows and 77 columns. It contains details and information about players and also their abilities
The aim of this challenge is to improve the quality by making sure the data is complete, accurate and clean before any analysis is done with it
